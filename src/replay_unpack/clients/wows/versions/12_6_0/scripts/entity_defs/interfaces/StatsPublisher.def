            Command to commit stats to Steam services.
            This call can be rate limited. Call frequency should be on the order of minutes, rather than seconds.
            You should only be calling this during major state changes such as the end of a round, the map changing,
            or the user leaving a server. This call is required to display the achievement unlock notification
            dialog though, so if you have called SetAchievement then it's advisable to call this soon after that.
